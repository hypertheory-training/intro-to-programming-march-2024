## Questions / Points from Today

1. Containers - We just started, but what did we use them for?
    - What are some benefits of running software in a container for development work?
    - What is that `docker-compose.yml` file doing?
2. HTTP - 
    - What is a "resource"
    - What are the key HTTP methods? What are there *semantics* (i.e. what are you saying to the user of your API when your resource implements each of the HTTP methods)?
    - What is a "representation" in HTTP?
3. Unit Testing
    - What is Unit Testing? (What is the "unit")?
    - Is Unit Testing *enough*?
    - What is Test-Driven-Development (TDD)?
        - What is the "form" of TDD? (what are the steps)
    - In .NET why do we:
        - Put our tests in a separate project from the code under test (known as the "System Under Test", or *yech* "SUT")
        - Why do we keep our Unit Tests separate from other kinds of tests?
