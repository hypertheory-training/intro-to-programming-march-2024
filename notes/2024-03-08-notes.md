## Creating Types
- Mostly uses Classes (or Records, which are the same, but more on that later.)
    - There are different "kinds" of classes - we use them to do different kinds of things.
        - Entities
            - each instance of that object has specific identity
        - Services
            - Don't usually have much state, they just do work.
        - Values
            - do not have specific identity - their "value" is their identity
