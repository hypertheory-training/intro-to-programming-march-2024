# First Day of Class

- Got into the VMs
- Did introductions, Dune 2 featured prominently
- Did some git setup and created our repo.
- Making a change 

## Started a Todos API

- Created an Asp.Net Core API Project
    - Did a "minimal" API - that means we aren't using controllers. (We'll do that later).
    - While we are doing development on our machine, we wanted our API to run at `http://localhost:1337` so we edited the `launchSettings.json` file in the `Properties` folder of the API to use port 1337. We also told it *not* to launch our browser to see the OpenApi documentation
        - You can still get to that by going to `http://localhost:1337/swagger` in the browser.
    - we removed the sample code for the Weather Forecast.
    - We added a `app.MapGet` to handle any http GET requests to the `/status` resource.
    - We just had it return a 200.
    - We briefly saw how to "test" it with the Postman tool.
    - We looked at `.http` files in Visual Studio for manually testing an API.
    - We learned that the API has to be **running** to send and handle a request (look in the Windows Terminal ([>_])) 
    - We added an xUnit Test Project.
    - We looked at tests using the `[Fact]` attribute.
    - We briefly looked at tests with the `[Theory]` attribute.
    - We wrote a test using the `HttpClient` to make a call to our API to "automate" what we were doing with the `.http` file so it can be run locally repeatably, and in our pipeline.
    - We used the Asp.Net TestHost to host the API in our tests to speed them up and make them less "flaky". (no need to run the API first).
    - We used a little Nuget package called "Alba" to simplify our test.


## Possible Questions You Should be Able to Answer after Day 1

- What is .NET? What is .NET Core?
- What is a "Web API" (or a RESTful API, or an HTTP API, all the same) any why do we create them?
- Why do we, as developers, write automated tests for our code?
- What is a "Project Reference" in Visual Studio?
- What is NuGet?
- Please note: Nobody is expecting you to answer questions like "What is the method on the web application you use to tell routing how to handle a GET (or POST, etc.) request at runtime? Or anyting about the C# stuff at all yet.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- In Visual Studio Code
    - to open an integrated terminal window, hit `Ctrl+Backtick`
